# Message Scheduling for Performant, Many-Core Belief Propagation

This repository holds source code for the paper "Message Scheduling for Performant, Many-Core Belief Propagation." We provide our implementations of Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP), Residual Belief Propagation (RBP), and Residual Splash (RS) on the GPU, as well as serial LBP, RBP, and Variable Elimination for comparison.
