# Message Scheduling for Performant, Many-Core Belief Propagation

This repository holds source code for the paper "Message Scheduling for Performant, Many-Core Belief Propagation." We provide our implementations of Randomized Belief Propagation (RnBP), our main contribution from this work, as well as Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP), Residual Belief Propagation (RBP), and Residual Splash (RS) on the GPU, and serial LBP, RBP, and Variable Elimination for comparison.
